# PDF Decryptor

A simple web application for decrypting PDF files (Note: actual PDF decryption is not implemented in this example; it utilizes pdf-lib for demonstration).

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pdf-decryptor.git
    cd pdf-decryptor
    ```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser to run the application.

## Features

- Upload a PDF file
- Input a password (not implemented in the current version)
- Download a decrypted PDF (Note: only bypasses encryption in PDF-lib)

## Usage

This project uses `pdf-lib`, but please note that it does not truly decrypt encrypted PDFs. Always handle sensitive data with care.
